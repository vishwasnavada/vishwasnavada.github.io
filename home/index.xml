      <description>Biography I&amp;rsquo;m a Full stack Hardware design engineer. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m pursuing my master&amp;rsquo;s degree in High-Speed Digital Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. I work on things related to electronics, such as high-speed board design, circuit design, digital design, Verilog development, embedded development, etc. Yeah that&amp;rsquo;s what I do as a professional. As a hobbyist, I do much more than these things.</description>
